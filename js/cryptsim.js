                     Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money that’s based on blockchain technology. You may be familiar with the most popular versions, Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are more than 5,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation.
                 </p>

        <h3>
        How Does Cryptocurrency Work?
        </h3>
                 <p>
                     A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. Instead, these tasks are broadly distributed among a cryptocurrency’s users via the internet.
                 </p>
             
                 <p>
                     You can use crypto to buy regular goods and services, although most people invest in cryptocurrencies as they would in other assets, like stocks or precious metals. While cryptocurrency is a novel and exciting asset class, purchasing it can be risky as you must take on a fair amount of research to fully understand how each system works.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                     Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, first outlined in principle by Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2008 paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Nakamoto described the project as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”
    
    That cryptographic proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified and recorded on a blockchain.
                 </p>

                 <h3>
                     What is a Blockchain?
                 </h3>
                 <p>
              A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions in code. In practice, it’s a little like a checkbook that’s distributed across countless computers around the world. Transactions are recorded in “blocks” that are then linked together on a “chain” of previous cryptocurrency transactions.
                 </p>
      
                 <p>
                      “Imagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day,” says Buchi Okoro, CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax. “Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
        With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. Software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.
    
    To prevent fraud, each transaction is checked using one of two main validation techniques: proof of work or proof of stake.

        How to Invest in Cryptocurrency
                 </h3>
                 <p>
        Cryptocurrency can be purchased on peer-to-peer networks and cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase and Bitfinex. Keep an eye out for fees, though, as some of these exchanges charge what can be prohibitively high costs on small crypto purchases. Coinbase, for instance, charges a fee of 0.5% of your purchase plus a flat fee of $0.99 to $2.99 depending on the size of your transaction.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        More recently, the investing app Robinhood started offering the ability to buy several of the top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, without the fees of many of the major exchanges.

                     Unless you have been living under a rock, there’s a high chance that you may have heard of a little cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. Especially after a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that Tesla bought US$1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, and announced that it expects to begin accepting bitcoins as a form of payment for its products in the near future.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Not to mention that Singapore’s biggest bank, DBS (SGX: D05) announced that it will set up a Digital Exchange that will allow investors to trade in cryptocurrencies. You may have also been following the volatile virtual currency’s price movements and have done your extensive due diligence on it. Now, you are ready to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies that you may have researched.

                 <h3>
                     Before you buy Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies
                 </h3>
                 <p>
                     If you have stumbled upon this article and have next to no knowledge about cryptocurrencies, I would urge you to read our cryptocurrency for <a href = "beginners’ article."><u>https://blog.seedly.sg/cryptocurrency-basics-bitcoin/</u></a
                 </p>
             
                 <p>
                     But here are some basic things you need to know. First, you need to know that Bitcoin is numero uno when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created and is the longest surviving one thus far. Its longevity and popularity add to its security due to the nature of how blockchain works. I may be simplifying things a bit but in general, the more blocks a cryptocurrency has, the more secure its network. This also adds to its trustworthiness. As such, Bitcoin is in a category of its own as all other cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin are classified as altcoins (short for alternatives to Bitcoin).
                 </p>
                  <p>
                     Whereas for altcoins, the most popular one is Ethereum: a blockchain platform that allows users to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on top of it. I am just barely scratching the surface as there is so much more to learn. As such, you need to really do your due diligence and fully understand the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies first before diving into it.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                    After all, your investment portfolio should be a reflection of your well-researched convictions and the amount of risk that you are willing to take. The worse thing you can do is to blindly copy someone else’s portfolio and end up losing money without even knowing why. A good place to start would be to develop an appreciation of the underlying technological innovation behind cryptocurrencies and a good understanding of the long-term risk and reward ratio of this asset class.

                     What Do You Need to Start Buying Cryptocurrency?
                 </h3>
                 <p>
                      At the very least, there are a few things that you need to start investing in cryptocurrency:
    
                 <ul>
                 <li>Personal identification documents for verification (some exchanges like Coinhako use Singpass MyInfo)</li>
                 <li>A Xfers Account to withdraw your money into your bank account for some platforms</li>
                 <li>Secure connection to the internet (public WiFi is a no-go)</li>
                 <li>Phone for two-factor authentication</li>
                 <li>Cryptocurrency exchange account</li>
                 <li>Valid methods to deposit or withdraw fiat money from the exchanges (bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, etc.</li>    
                 <li>Secured personal cryptocurrency wallet to store your crypto (this is optional but recommended)</li>    
                 </ul>
                    Speaking of cryptocurrency wallets there are two main types of crypto wallets you need to know.
                 </p>
                 <h4>
                    Hot Wallets
                 </h4>
                 <p>
                    First, we have Hot Wallets: cryptocurrency wallets operated from devices that connect to the internet. Although Bitcoin itself is almost impossible to hack, hackers can still steal the private key to your hot wallet and steal the coins stored on your crypto wallet that is connected to the internet. But, what you give up in security you gain in convenience as you can trade your cryptocurrencies easily.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    An example of a hot wallet is the exchange wallet that is given to you when you open your cryptocurrency exchange account. This is basically a custodian account for your cryptocurrency where the exchange holds the private keys to your coins. Be careful about this as if in the event that the exchange is hacked, you might lose your cryptocurrency. This is why in the cryptocurrency world, the phrase ‘not your key not your coin’ is wisdom many adhere to. As without the private keys, you technically do not own the bitcoin.
                 </p>
                 <h4>
                    Cold Wallets
                 </h4>
                 <p>
                    Alternatively, you can store your cryptocurrencies in a cold wallet. Put simply, the cold wallet/offline wallet/hardware wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that stores your cryptocurrency offline. These cold wallets store your private key on hardware that is offline. Some even come with compatible software that allows you to view your crypto portfolio without exposing your private key.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    There are two main types of hardware wallets that come with their advantages and disadvantages. You have your paper wallet which can be created and printed out from some websites.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    During the creation of the paper wallet, you have both public keys and private keys that are printed out. Some people keep their private keys in a highly secured place and only import the private key into the wallet only at the moment of making a transaction. This method is more secure, but the downside is that it is very inconvenient to trade your cryptocurrency with this paper wallet.

                    Cryptocurrency ATMs in Singapore (Bitcoin ATMs in Singapore)
                 </h3>
                 <p>
                    You can head to the cryptocurrency ATMs around Singapore to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly and instantly with cash. The buying process is as such: you deposit fiat currency (e.g. SGD) and withdraw cryptocurrency to your secure digital wallet. Whereas the selling process is reversed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    This transaction method is convenient as you can skip any sign-ups or variation processes. You only need a safe and secure digital wallet to withdraw the cryptocurrency to. However, convenience does not come cheap as according to Coin ATM Radar, these ATMs charge between a whopping 4.1% – 6.9% for cryptocurrency transactions and have minimum transaction fees that start from $10.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    These fees are generally higher than buying cryptocurrencies on crypto exchanges like Coinbase. Thus, if possible, you should sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange account to avoid these high fees.

        <h2>Cryptocurrency exchange platforms</h2>
        
        <p>
            If you are unfettered by the issues above and are wondering where you can get started, you can buy and trade cryptocurrencies through crypto exchanges, 
            such as <a href = "https://ftx.com/en" target = "_blank">FTX</a>, <a href = "https://www.kucoin.com/" target = "_blank"><u>Kucoin</u></a>, 
            <a href = "https://www.gemini.com/apac/singapore" target = "_blank"><u>Gemini</u></a>, 
            <a href = "https://www.coinbase.com/" target = "_blank"><u>Coinbase</u></a>, 
            and <a href = "https://crypto.com/sg/" target = "_blank"><u>Crypto.com</u></a>. When choosing your crypto exchange, consider the following factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trading fees</li>
            <li>Types of coins offered by the exchange</li>
            <li>Ease of depositing, withdrawing and exchanging between cryptocurrency and Singapore dollar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of these platforms like Coinbase also offer lending and staking options. 
            However, there are platforms like <a href = "https://www.hodlnaut.com/" target = "_blank"><u>Hodlnaut</u></a>, 
            <a href = "https://celsius.network/" target = "_blank"><u>Celsius</u></a> and <a href = "https://blockfi.com/" target = "_blank"><u>BlockFi</u></a> that specialise in providing cryptocurrency interest accounts.</p>
        <p><b>Update</b>: As of 12 November 2021, <a href = "https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/binancecom-users-in-singapore-given-one-month-to-withdraw-assets-redeem" target = "_blank"><u>Singaporeans are no longer able to purchase or trade crypto on Binance.com</u></a> due to MAS regulations. 
            <a href = "https://fortune.com/2021/11/10/huobi-singapore-ban-shut-down-china-crypto-exchange/" target = "_blank"><u>Huobi will also be ceasing operations in Singapore</u></a>, and will be closing all Singaporean accounts by 31 March 2022. 
            Singapore-based users are strongly encouraged to withdraw all their assets from Huobi before then.</p>
        <p>Given that these platform closures can occur at any time, it is crucial for Singapore-based investors to keep abreast of news on platform regulation changes.</p>
        
        <h2>Regulations: Is Cryptocurrency legal in Singapore?</h2>
        <p>
            In 2019, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the <a href = "https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/acts/payment-services-act" target="_blank"><u>Payment Services Act</u></a>, which regulates cryptocurrency, 
            or digital payment tokens (DPT) service providers for money-laundering and terrorism financing risks. 
            More recently in Jan 2021, MAS announced the <a href = "https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Bills-Supp/41-2020/Published/20201102?DocDate=20201102" target="_blank"><u>Payment Services (Amendment) Bill</u></a>, 
            which requires any entity that facilitates the transmission, exchange or custody of cryptocurrencies to be licensed 
            and comply with a wider set of rules and regulations. One such consequence of the Payment Services Act is that 
            crypto exchanges now have to impose a stock limit of $5,000 for individual accounts.
        </p>
        <p><strong>As a crypto investor in Singapore, note that the crypto landscape is largely unregulated for retail investors. 
            This means you will be offered little protection or recourse 
            if you fall prey to a crypto-related scam or from callous crypto investments, 
            so practice caution and prudence when investing in cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>Should you invest in cryptocurrency?</h2>
    
        <p>There is no doubt that cryptocurrencies are gaining in popularity among retail investors and institutions. 
            For example,<a href = "https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/cryptocurrency-on-paypal-faq-faq4398" target = "_blank"><u>PayPal users</u></a> in the US can now buy, sell, hold, and spend cryptocurrencies, 
            <a href = "https://www.coindesk.com/jpmorgan-to-let-clients-invest-in-bitcoin-fund-for-first-time-sources/" target = "_blank"><u>JPMorgan's bitcoin fund</u></a> for its clients is slated to roll out as early as this summer, 
            and household names like DBS launched Asia's first direct crypto offering for private banking clients in May 2021, 
            and announced that it would be providing an ecosystem for fundraising through asset tokenisation and 
            secondary trading of digital assets including cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <p>While the future of cryptocurrency seems promising, here are some issues you should consider before making your first crypto purchase.</p>
        
        <h3>Three key issues with cryptocurrencies</h3>
    
        <h4>An asset, currency, security… or something else altogether?</h4>
        <p>Crypto is the first non-correlated asset class since equities in the 1600s, shared Catherine Wood, 
            founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management. There has been much debate surrounding the classification of cryptocurrencies, 
            and consequently the regulations surrounding crypto. While there has been a smattering of regulations for cryptocurrencies, 
            a clearer outlook for crypto will be paved when clearer guidelines have been defined globally.</p>
        <h4>High volatility</h4>
        <p>Crypto has seen vast swings in prices over the years, more recently from heightened regulatory pressures or a tweet from Elon Musk. 
            <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/bitcoin-btc-price-plunges-but-bottom-could-be-near-.html"target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin suffered a 30% drop from its record high</u></a> in mid-April this year, 
            and crypto trading volume fell 43% in June following <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57549543"target="_blank"><u>China's crackdown on the sector</u></a>. 
            If you are thinking of buying crypto, its high volatility is definitely something to consider before allocating your funds.</p>
        <h4>Negative environmental impact</h4>
        <p>The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has been cause for concern among environmentalists. 
            As the price goes up, the algorithms to create new blocks on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin become increasingly difficult,
            leading to greater energy consumption. While some purport that close to three quarters of 
            Bitcoin's energy needs come from renewable sources, these figures have been highly contested.</p>
        
        <h3>Three things to consider before investing in cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <p>As a digital wealth advisor committed to making it easier for you to build long-term wealth, 
            consider these three things when deciding if you should invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <h4>Risk appetite</h4>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments, so it is important to assess your risk appetite. 
            If you are generally risk-averse, crypto might not be for you. If you would still like to dabble in cryptocurrency, 
            consider waiting for cryptocurrency ETFs managed by global fund managers to become available in the Singapore market.</p>
        <h4>Financial goals</h4>
        <p>Consider your financial goals, such as setting up an emergency fund, saving up for a family, or building your retirement nest egg. 
            If you require short-term liquidity or are cash-tight, remain focused on achieving your financial goals first 
            before making allocations to crypto.</p>
        <H4>Investment horizon and strategy for cryptocurrencies</H4>
        <p>If you have spare cash after taking the above financial goals into consideration and would like to start investing in crypto, decide your investment horizon and strategy for cryptocurrencies, such as buying and holding on to cryptocurrencies for the long-term or trade crypto aggressively in the short term.</p>

        <h1>5 Common Cryptocurrency Scams to Avoid</h1>
    
    <p>Written By: <a href = "https://blog.seedly.sg/author/joel-koh" target="_blank"><u>Joel Ong</u></a></p>

    <p>As the cryptocurrency industry is still in its infancy and quite complex, investing in cryptocurrency has become a hunting ground for scammers to con new investors.</p>
        <p>To protect yourself here are some tips:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>When something sounds too good to be true it probably is. Any investments that promise unusually high and guaranteed returns are most likely to be a scam as good investing takes time.</li>
            <li>Always do extensive research and due diligence before investing.</li>
            <li>Do not invest in anything outside of your circle of competence.</li>
            <li>Only use reputable cryptocurrency exchanges.</li>
            <li>Gain a deep understanding of the potential risks and rewards of your investments.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>1. Social Media Cryptocurrency Scams</h2>
        <p>Undoubtedly, social media has become a powerful and influential force in our society. </p>
        <p>But like all tools, it can be used as a force for good or evil.</p>
        <p>It comes as no surprise that hackers have been using social media to target <a href="https://blog.seedly.sg/crypto-staking-guide/"target="_blank"><u>holders of cryptocurrency</u></a> .</p>
        <p>These hackers are using fake social media profiles and have hacked popular social media profiles to con people of their cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p>On top of the cryptocurrency investment scams happening in Singapore, we are seeing cryptocurrency scams happening elsewhere as well.</p>
        <p>A May 2021 report from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) highlighted the growing problem of cryptocurrency investment scams.</p>
        <p>A May 2021 <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/blog_posts/Cryptocurrency%20buzz%20drives%20record%20investment%20scam%20losses/cryptocurrency_spotlight.pdf"target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) highlighted the growing problem of cryptocurrency investment scams.</p>
        <p>From October 2020 to March 2021, there were <b>7,000</b>  cryptocurrency investment scams reported. Collectively, the victims of these scams reported losses of about <b>US$80 million (S$105.6 million)!</b></p>
        <img class = "col-12" src = "https://cdn-blog.seedly.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01134904/Screenshot-2021-06-01-at-1.47.05-PM.png" height="350px" width="550px">
        
        <h2>2. Cryptocurrency Ponzi Schemes</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, a Ponzi scheme refers to an investment scam named after Charles Ponzi; an American who conned thousands of people to invest in a fake postage stamp scheme in the 1920s.</p>
        <img class = "col-12" src = "https://cdn-blog.seedly.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01153530/Ponzi1920.jpeg" height="350px" width="300px">
        <p>Investors are lured to invest in the scheme with promises of unusually high returns with little or no risk.</p>
        <p>Instead of generating profers, the scammers look for new investors to invest in the scam and pay the older investors with the money that the new investors invested.</p>
        <p>The investors who receive the payouts would often recommend their friends to invest in the scheme or put in more money themselves.</p>
        <p>The scheme collapses on itself when it becomes more and more difficult to lure new investors, or when some investors want to withdraw their money or the scammer escapes with the money.</p>
        <p>Typically, Ponzi scheme scammers leverage the latest innovation, technology, product or growth industry (i.e. cryptocurrency) to tempt investors to invest with the promise of unusually high returns.</p>
        <p>Prospective investors tend to let their guard down when assessing this type of investment opportunity as they see something as disruptive or innovative.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Fake Coin Offerings</h2>
        <p>According to CoinMarketCap, there are about 5,436 cryptocurrencies in existence and new blockchain project and their cryptocurrency tokens being minted every day.</p>
        <p>You will have to be hyper-vigilant when evaluating these new coins as even the more legit coins have ridiculous names like Dogecoin and OMG.</p>
        <p>This means that it will be difficult to spot fraudulent cryptocurrencies and their blockchain projects..</p>
        <p>A high profile example of a fraudulent coin would be the 'My Big Coins' created by the company of the same name.</p>
        <p>My Big Coin (MBC) was started back in 2013 by CEO John Roche. Like many blockchain businesses, the company set out to implement blockchain technology for the gaming and cannabis industries.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, the company announced that they would back each individual MBC coin with gold.</p>
        <img class="col-12" src="https://cdn-blog.seedly.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01164732/bkn7kiyqiwzxhzudfo0k.jpeg" height = 350px width="300px">
        <p>Unfortunately, the house of cards collapsed when the U.S. Government <a href="https://coingeek.com/my-big-coin-founder-arrested-charged-with-fraud/" target="_blank"><u>arrested Randall Crater</u></a>  the founder of My Big Coin and MBC crypto in 2019.</p>
        <p>The arrest revealed that MBC coin was a fraudulent cryptocurrency and the coin was not backed by gold.</p>
        <p>Also, here are some common red flags to help you evaluate if a cryptocurrency is a fraud:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plagiarized investor documents and/or whitepapers.</li>
            <li>Promises of unusually high and guaranteed returns.</li>
            <li>Countdown clock to pressure you to get in on the deal.</li>
            <li>Fake management teams.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Fake Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2>
        <p>Like stock exchanges, cryptocurrency exchanges are a vital part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as they allow people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <p>However, many of the exchanges are typically not regulated and are prone to scams.</p>
        <p>These scammers have levelled up and created fake cryptocurrency exchanges and even manipulate trading volumes on those big exchanges to entice potential investors and scam them of their funds.</p>
        <p>Some telltale signs of a fake exchange include an unsecured website, harassment of users, freezing of cryptocurrency withdrawals or in some cases the founder may run away with your investments.</p>
        <p>To ensure that you do not fall prey to such schemes, you should stick to the bigger and more reputable cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
        <h2>5. Pump And Dump Schemes</h2>
        <p>Pump and dump schemes are not new as they have been perpetuated as long as the stock market has been in existence.</p>
        <p>Although these schemes are not new, the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency markets has made them more susceptible to this abusive market practice.</p>
        <p>The mechanics of this scheme are simple.</p>
        <p>An individual or group would buy up most of the circulating supply of a small cryptocurrency or coin with a small market capitalisation and low liquidity. This would drive up the price.</p>
        <p>The next step would be to promote and pump up the coin with a publicity campaign.</p>
        <p>Some methods of promotion include promoting the cryptocurrency apps like Discord, Slack or Telegram to pump the coin and drive up demand.</p>
        <p>The schemers would also engage cryptocurrency influencers on social media platforms like TikTok or YouTube to hype up the coin.</p>
        <p>Not to mention that the schemers would also create fake news stories like reports of fake celebrity endorsements.</p>
        <p>This will often result in the coin going up in value temporarily as a result of this promotion.</p>
        <p>Next, the people who are pumping the coin will 'dump' the coin and sell without warning.</p>
        <img class = "col-12" src = "https://cdn-blog.seedly.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01125033/18-pump-and-dump-3.jpeg" height="350px" width="550px">
        <p>Be very wary of such schemes as more often than not, you are being manipulated by the pumpers of the coin who will sell when the coin reaches their pre-determined price.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips on how to avoid them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are looking to buy smaller cryptocurrencies that have a small market capitalisation and are not broadly traded, you need to be very proficient and do your own due diligence on the coin.</li>
            <li>Take everything you read with a pinch of salt as every publication you read has an agenda.</li>
            <li>You will also need to gain a deep understanding of what the blockchain project is about and what it does before even considering buying the coin.</li>
        </ol>
