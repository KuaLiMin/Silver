                     For young and healthy people, putting together a funeral plan may sound like a foreign and unnecessary concept. Still, there are many advantages to sharing and recording your funeral preference, regardless of your age.

        You will reduce stress for your family
        </h3>
                 <p>
                     When someone close to us passes away, grief often makes difficult even the most straightforward task. Because funerals tend to be planned immediately following a death, this usually means that a family member must dive immediately into planning a large event and making significant financial decisions (funeral costs can easily surpass S$10,000) while dealing with enormous grief.
                 </p>
             
                 <p>
                     The more of your funeral that you plan out in advance, the easier it will be for your family to execute your instructions and wishes. Instead of calling funeral homes and comparing caskets, they will be able to focus their time on supporting each other.

                 </h3>
                 <p>
              Suppose you pass away unexpectedly and you have not outlined your funeral wishes. In that case, your family will be left to guess what you would have wanted. If two family members disagree, that can lead to unnecessary tension in the funeral planning process. Even Michelle Obama has spoken about fighting with her brother after her father’s death over whether to get a basic fancy casket.
                 </p>
      
                 <p>
                      Even if you are sure you have mentioned to your family that you did prefer cremation over a burial (or vice-versa), grief can cloud memory, so the more you can record, the better. This also holds true for more minor funeral decisions, depending on what songs you want to be played or what charity you prefer people to make memorial donations to. Each decision you make (and record) in advance is one more minor decision your family members will need to create and one more occasional opportunity for family tension.

                 </h3>
                 <p>
        Many people have ideas about what they would like done surrounding their death. Whether you feel that a burial is essential for religious reasons or prefer a lively celebration of your life over a somber affair, planning your funeral in advance will help ensure that the things you find most important will happen. It also gives you a chance to inject some of your personality into the event and reflect on how you will be remembered. This can provide a lot of comfort in your final days.

                 <p>
        Many people do not think to shop around when grieving and rushing to plan a funeral, which can lead to thousands of dollars in unnecessary costs. If you plan ahead, you can take time to compare funeral homes, which often vary in price by thousands of dollars for almost identical services. Similarly, you are more likely to shop around for expensive items like caskets and headstones, which can often cost about half the price when not purchased through the funeral home.

                 <p>
        Funerals are expensive, even for the savviest of shoppers with simple plans. A basic cremation with a small service will generally cost thousands of dollars. By preparing for your funeral in advance, you will be able to determine precisely how much everything will cost and make a plan for how to pay for it. Once you know how much you will need, consider purchasing insurance or putting the funds in a payable-upon-death bank account.

                 <p>
        While talking to your family about death may sound uncomfortable, many people find that it leads to meaningful conversations about what is essential to each of you. Frequently, people want to talk about the end of life but feel awkward or do not know how to bring it up themselves. When you open the door, you may find that others in your family have been thinking about their end of life and want to share their thoughts and preferences.

        If you are unsure how to bring it up, you can even use this article as an excuse. Try a line like, “I saw an article the other day on the benefits of planning your own funeral. It made me think about it a bit, and I came to a conclusion that… What would you all want?” You may end up learning things about your family that you would not have expected.

                     We do not like to talk about death. It is not a happy topic. Thinking about it is worse. It just reminds us how it will all end for ourselves and all we love. But, like taxes, death is one of the certainties of life. And, like taxes, we have to count the cost.

                 <p>
                     Unless you have been through it before, most Singaporean would not know what to do when a death happens in the family. Even if we do know what to do, we may not want to be the one doing it in our time of grief.
                 </p>
             
                 <p>
                     That is where the funeral home comes in. Once called, no matter the time of day or night, they will usually be with you within the hour to manage the rest of the process with you. So your first to look for a funeral home from among the <b>Association of Funeral Directors (Singapore)</b>.

                     Step 2: Obtain a Certificate of Cause of Death (CCOD)
                 </h3>
                 <p>
              The next thing is to get a CCOD. How that is done depends on where the death occurred – at the hospital, at home, or overseas.
                 </p>
                 <h4>
                     At the hospital
                 </h4>
                 <p>
                      A doctor at the hospital will certify the cause of death if it is known and natural. You will need the ID of the deceased for this. The CCOD will then be issued on the spot. You can then contact a funeral home to prepare the body for the funeral. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
        If the doctor cannot certify the cause of death, you can either call the police to send the body to Mortuary@HSA in a Police Hearse, or the funeral home can do this for you. The coroner at the mortuary will determine the cause of death and if an autopsy is needed. Then, you will be able to collect the body (usually the next day).
                 </p>
                 <p>
        The cost of transporting the body is either free or included as part of the funeral home’s package. If an autopsy report is needed, it will cost S$160.50. For private autopsies, the administrative fee is S$5,863.60 (with GST) and every day that the body is kept in storage, it will cost you S$165.85.
    
                 </p>
                 <h4>
                     At home
                 </h4>
                 <p>
        Get your family doctor or neighborhood GP to make a house call to certify the death. Some clinics have 24-hour house-call services you can tap on. If the doctor cannot approve the cause of death, the body needs to be sent to the mortuary. Total costs of this procedure typically fall in the S$200 to S$250 range.
                 </p>
                 <h4>
                     Overseas
                 </h4>
                 <p>
        A death aboard needs to be registered with the relevant authorities in that country. Then, you have 2 options: either bring the body home for burial or cremation, or cremate the body aboard and bring home the ashes. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
        If you want to bring the body home, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can give you advice on finding undertakers in that country and the cost of repatriation. On our end, it will be the funeral director here who will make all the arrangements to receive the body in Singapore. You will need to pay them at least an extra S$500 on top of the funeral package.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        It is not cheap to bring a body home. Figures are hard to come by because it depends on where you are repatriating the body from. According to IATA (a worldwide airline trade association), a body need to be embalmed for it to travel outside of a country. That cost, the cost of preparing the body and coffin for travel, and flight fees will vary from country to country. Estimates put the cost at upward of S$5,000. It is more likely to be S$10,000 and more.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        This is why it is important to get good travel insurance, which can cover the cost of repatriation in the event of death. Finally, you will also need to apply for a Coffin (Import) Permit at the Port Health Office or the Airport Health Office. The coffin import permit fee is S$17.50.

        Step 3: Register the death
                 </h3>
                 <p>
        The CCOD is then used to register the death. You can do this at the Neighborhood Police Center/Posts (45 minutes) or the Citizen Service Centre, ICA Building (30 minutes). 
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Remember to bring these documents:
                 </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CCOD</li>
                    <li>Deceased’s ID such as IC, passport, or birth certificate (which will be cancelled)</li>
                    <li>Informant’s ID (IC or passport)</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>
        Once you have registered for the death, the centre will keep the CCOD, while you will be issued a Death Certificate. All this needs to be done within 24 hours of the death. There are no fees involved at this stage.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        You will need the death certificate to arrange an obituary in the newspapers, the funeral, and the burial or cremation.

        You will have to decide if you want to announce the death in local newspapers. This is a good way of letting all your friends and relatives know about the wake and funeral details. It costs from S$1,348.20 (the smallest size) to place an obituary in the papers.

                 <p>
        Then comes the business of arranging the wake as well as the funeral itself. There will be some questions you need to answer in this regard, which affect the cost as well:
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Number of days</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Everything can be done in a single day or stretch to 7 days. 3-day wakes are the norm these days, but it varies depending on the culture.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Some Chinese people have a superstition that the days of the wake have to be odd numbers to signify the incomplete cycle of life and the hope of reincarnation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Muslims bury their loved ones within 24 hours of death for sanitary reasons since they do not embalm the bodies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Location of the wake</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        You can hold the wake in your home (whether HDB, private apartment or landed property) or at a funeral parlor. Cost-wise, doing it at home is cheaper, while the funeral parlor is more expensive as it would count as venue rental. However, it would be best if you also considered the convenience factor of each one. Here is a brief rundown of the pros and cons of your options.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>HDB void deck</b>: Usually held in the void deck of your home or other family members. You need to get a permit from the Town Council. It is convenient (you can quickly shower or rest or settle matters). But you cannot lock up the place after hours, so someone must always be around to keep vigil.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Private apartment grounds</b>: Need to get permission from the condo management. Otherwise, it is similar to the HDB void deck – convenient but needs to arrange for someone to be there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Landed property</b>: You need to get a permit from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) if you need to use part of the road outside your house. Otherwise, no permit is necessary. You can also lock up the place after hours. However, parking for your guests may be a hassle and pose an inconvenience to your neighbors.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Funeral parlor</b>: It is more expensive to hold a wake here, but the place is locked up at night, so you can go home to rest. However, some funeral parlor like Mt. Vernon Sanctuary is not exactly accessible.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Type of casket</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Most packages include the casket but you still have to pick one or opt for an upgrade.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Metal casket</b>: Bronze and coper ones are the most expensive because they are high quality and do not rust. They cannot be used for cremation, though.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Wooden casket</b>: Hardwoods like mahogany, cherry, walnut and oak are among your more expensive choices. Pine, poplar and veneer are cheaper and start from about S$700.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Paper casket</b>: Paper caskets are available for the environmentally conscious. They are not necessarily cheaper (they start at S$1,000), but they certainly do not cost the earth much. It takes 22kg of recycled paper to make one paper casket but 70kg of wood to make a wooden one.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Extent of wake & funeral</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Like any significant event in life, the wake and funeral can be as extravagant as you desire or as simple as you please. In Asian societies, lavish send-offs are often seen to measure a family’s love for the deceased. Religious beliefs also dictate the type of wake and funeral rites chosen.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        In recent years, changing norms have given the occasion a different spin. You can now get memorial videos to celebrate the life of the deceased, memorial boards where you can pen messages, and even themed funerals based on the deceased’s interest.

        Step 6: Burial or cremation
                 </h3>
                 <p>
        After the good-byes, you have to decide what to do with the remaining of your loved one – land burial, sea burial or cremation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Burial (land)</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        With Singapore running out of land, only one cemetery is now available in Choa Chu Kang. The burial period is limited to 15 years. After that, the remains have to be cremated or re-interred. Because of this, most people do not choose burial unless it is for religious reasons.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        It would cost you about S$315 for a Muslim, Parsi, or Bahai burial. The price goes steeply to S$940 for a Christian, Chinese or Hindu funeral.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Burial (sea)</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        You can opt to scatter the remains in the sea. This can be done 2.8km south of Pulau Semakau between 7 am and 7 pm. The MPA’s Port Marine Safety Control Centre can help you with this.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Now, you can even buy scattering tubes (from $200) to contain the remains for scattering instead of wrapping them up in a red or white cloth. Even bio-degradable urns (from $175) made from recycled paper and paper clay can be tossed into the sea without harming the environment. These are designed to float for about 20 minutes before sinking, giving families time to bid their final farewell.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Sea burial is potentially less environmentally damaging than a cremation. It is also much cheaper than burial or cremation (since you have to pay to store the urn at a columbarium). And generations after don’t have to maintain the niche. The con is that there is nowhere you can go to visit your loved one. A sea burial can cost anywhere from S$80 to over S$1,000, depending on how extravagant an affair is.
    
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Cremation</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        There are three crematoriums in Singapore: Mandai Crematorium (government), Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery (private) and Tse Toh Aum Temple (private).
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Cremation will require an urn to store the remains, a niche in a columbarium to store the urn, and a marble plaque engraved with your details to cover the niche. There’s nothing to stop you from keeping the urn at home, but that’ll mean that generations after that have to care for the urn or, at least, store it.

        Most people choose to have the urns placed at either a government columbarium (there are 3) or a private one (there are nearly 60). Choosing a government columbarium costs less, but you can’t pick your niche.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Here’s a rough guide to the costs:

        These aren’t the only options, however.

        <b>Tree burial</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        One new alternative for those who have their gardens is a tree burial. The remains are combined with the seed of a tree and placed in a biodegradable pot that can be planted. It’s eco-friendly and economical, and it can be pretty meaningful to know that the one you love is now part of a new circle of life. But, it also means that if you want to sell your house, you have to re-pot the plant or tell the new owners your loved one’s in their yard.

        <b>Keepsake</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Another idea is to turn your remains into a keepsake. Ang Chin Moh Funeral Directors offers the possibility of turning remains into diamonds (from S$4,588) or storing some of them in a locket. The Singapore Casket Co. remains to provide a similar service that can be turned into eternity gemstones (from S$1,700) which can then be sent into the keepsake of your choice.

        <b>Getting you affairs in order</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Knowing what and how much a funeral entail makes it even more important to settle as much as you can while you’re still around. There are several ways to get your affairs in order.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Make a will</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        If you go without a will, you’ll be leaving your family to second guess you on many issues including what to do with your money and all that you own. It’s a perfect storm for family quarrels.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        So, while you’re still here, it’s good to make your will to appoint:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>A trustee to manage your assets</li>
                    <li>A legal guardian for your children (in case you pass away before they’re adults)</li>
                    <li>Two executors to distribute your assets and manage your affairs after your death</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>
        Making a will costs about S$300 to S$1,200.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        The LPA is a legal document that allows those 21 and above to appoint one or more people to take action on their behalf if they lose the ability to make their own decisions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        It’s pretty easy to get an LPA. Just fill up a form and get a witness to certify it. Then, please make an appointment to submit it to the Office of Public Guardian. The LPA Form 1 costs S$50 to S$75 on top of the fees of the professionals (medical practitioners and lawyers) you engage in witnessing and certifying the application.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        A second form – Form 2 – if you have special requirements or want to customise power. This one costs S$200.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Advance Medical Directive (AMD)</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        This is also known as a living will, and it legally prevents your medical team from giving you any life-sustaining treatments to prolong your life if you become unconscious or terminally ill. Again, you need to fill up a form and get a doctor to certify it, which costs about $40. Once done, post the form to the Registry of Advance Medical Directives.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>How do I financially prepare for death?</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
        Apart from doing all the paperwork above, it can also be helpful to pre-plan your funeral (you can enlist the help of a funeral home). It puts you in control of how you want to depart finally. It’s also an excellent way to assess how much your funeral will cost and save up for it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        As you can see, the cost of the entire funeral process in Singapore is nothing to be sniffed at. The simplest of three-day wakes, cremation and storage in a columbarium can easily set you back by nearly S$7,000.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        And that’s just for one funeral. Factor both parents and parents-in-law; you might be forking out tens of thousands of dollars. Here are some options you can consider to help you set aside adequate funds.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Saving Accounts</b>: Putting aside money is always a good practice because it gives you a pool of cash for emergencies or big-budget items, which exactly describes a funeral. That said, savings accounts in Singapore don’t yield much interest. Your best bet is to find a high-interest savings account.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Singapore Savings Bonds</b>: The ever-popular Singapore Savings Bond is a very safe way to set aside a bunch of money for up to 10 years. It has higher yields than regular savings – interest rates increase the longer you invest and doesn’t require much to start (just $500).
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Endowment Plans</b>: Insurance companies help you grow your wealth in two ways – insurance saving plans (also known as endowment plans) and investment-linked plans. Endowment plans are the lower risk of the two and are suitable for setting aside a funeral fund. You get the protection insurance that affords a higher percentage of returns compared to pure savings.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Insurance</b>: If you have a life insurance policy, the payout in the event of death will help cover the cost of the funeral and the welfare of those who are left behind.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        <b>Pre-payment</b>: Some funeral homes allow you to pre-pay in instalments. For example, SFS Care lets you pay in advance for your funeral so that your loved ones will not be financially burdened. The package is called Legacy, and the package involves monthly payments of $138 for 10 years for a 3-day funeral package at a void deck. If you die before half of the $6,500 package is paid, your family can top up the rest. If you have already spent more than half before passing on, the balanced is waived.
                 </p>
                 <p>
        It’s sobering to think about death and all that comes with it. But to not think about it and plan for it, especially financially, would make the death even more tragic. It’s when we’ve given death due consideration that we can indeed be free to embrace life.
